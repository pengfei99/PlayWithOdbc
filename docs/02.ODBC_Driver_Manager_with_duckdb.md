# Setup a odbc data source for duckdb

## 1. Install Duck db

DuckDB is an **in-process SQL OLAP** database management system

For more information, you can visit their official [website](https://duckdb.org/)

It offers many API, Here I only show the CLI API for linux.

For other API installations, you can go to [[https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/|installation page]]

```shell
# get the latest stable binary
wget https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/releases/download/v0.8.0/duckdb_cli-linux-amd64.zip

# unzip it
unzip duckdb_cli-linux-amd64.zip

# after unzip, you will find a binary called duckdb, use the below command to run it
./duckdb
```



## 2. Load different data sources

Duckdb can read the below data sources:
  * json
  * csv
  * parquet

Here, we only show csv and parquet

### 2.1  Load csv files

```shell
# read the csv file with auto infer header, delimiter, etc. 
select * from read_csv_auto('file.csv')

# if the infered delimiter is not correct, we can overwrite it
select * from read_csv_auto('file.csv', delimiter='|')

# create a temporaray table
create table sf_fire as select * from read_csv_auto('/home/pengfei/data_set/sf_fire/sf_fire.csv');

```

### 2.2 Load parquet files

```shell
create table sf_fire as select * from read_parquet('/home/pengfei/data_set/sf_fire/sf_fire_snappy.parquet');
```



### 2.3 Run some SQL operation

Once you have created a table, you can use all the functions of SQL to manipulate the table. Below are some simple examples

```sql
select * from sf_fire limit 5;

select count(*) as total_row from sf_fire;

select CallType, count(*) as call_number from sf_fire group by CallType order by call_number desc;
```

**DuckDB does not persist any table, after shutdown, all tables will be lost**. If you want to save the table, 
you need to export the table in csv, or parquet files

## 3. Export data

### 3.1 Export data to CSV files

```shell
# let's create a table which we want to export
create table call_type as select CallType, count(*) as call_number from sf_fire group by CallType order by call_number desc;

# now let's export table call_type to a csv file
COPY call_type TO '/tmp/output.csv' (HEADER, DELIMITER ',');

# The result of queries can also be directly exported to a CSV file.
COPY (SELECT * FROM call_type) TO '/tmp/output.csv' (HEADER, DELIMITER ',');
```
### 3.2 Export data to parquet files

```shell
COPY call_type TO '/tmp/output.parquet' (FORMAT PARQUET);

COPY (SELECT * FROM call_type) TO '/tmp/output.parquet' (FORMAT PARQUET);
```

## 4. Configure duckdb odbc DSN

You can find the official doc [here](https://duckdb.org/docs/api/odbc/linux)

### 4.1  Set up the ODBC driver manager

Check section 1 of [ODBC_Driver_Manager_with_SQLite](01.ODBC_Driver_Manager_with_SQLite.md). We already showed how to 
install an ODBC driver manager in linux.

### 4.2 Download the duckdb ODBC driver

The duckdb ODBC Linux Asset that contains the following artifacts:

- **libduckdb_odbc.so**: the DuckDB driver compiled to Ubuntu 16.04.
- **unixodbc_setup.sh**: a setup script to aid the configuration of odbc driver manager in Linux.

You can download the latest version from this location https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/releases

For example, the current stable version can be downloaded from this 
location https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/releases/download/v0.8.1/duckdb_odbc-linux-amd64.zip

Unzip the zip file and put it in somewhere which you want. In our case, we put it in `/home/pengfei/Tools/duckdb_odbc`

### 4.3 Configure the ODBC driver manager

To define a DSN for duckdb, we need to register the duckdb odbc driver in the driver manager. The configuration
file is located at **.odbcinst.ini**.

Below is an example of the configuration file

```text
[ODBC]
Trace = yes
TraceFile = /tmp/odbctrace

[DuckDB Driver]
Driver = /home/pengfei/Tools/duckdb_odbc/libduckdb_odbc.so

```

- The **[ODBC]** section is the DM configuration section.

    - Trace: it enables the ODBC trace file using the option yes. 

    - TraceFile: the absolute system file path for the ODBC trace file.

- The **[DuckDB Driver]** section registered the DuckDB odbc driver into ODBC driver manager.
    - Driver: defines the absolute system file path of the DuckDB driver which we just downloaded.

### 4.4 Configure the duckdb ODBC DSN

The DSN(Data Source Name) is the identification of the database which the client application will call when it wants to
connect to the database. It requires a registered odbc driver.

The configuration file of DSN is located at **.odbc.ini**.

Below file is an example
```text
[DuckDB]
Driver = DuckDB Driver
Database=:memory:
```

[DuckDB]: between the brackets we define a DSN for the DuckDB. It's not **case-sensitive**, so duckdb, or DuckDB is the 
          same.
  - `Driver`: it describes the registered driverâ€™s name, which is defined in the `.odbcinst.ini`. 
  - `Database`: it describes the database name used by DuckDB, By default, the value is `:memory:`, which means 
                nothing is persistent. It can be a file path to a .db in the system.

Another example of duckdb DSN. In this example, the database is not in memory anymore. It's in a file. When we load 
a parquet file to a table. The data in the parquet file will be copied in the `sample.db` file.
```text
[Fduckdb]
Description=DuckDB inmemory database
Driver=DuckDB Driver
Database=/home/pengfei/data_set/odbc/duckdb/sample.db
```

## 5. Use odbc client to connect to a duckdb

```shell
# get the available DSN
odbcinst -c -s -q

# connect to a duckdb via odbc DSN
isql -v duckdb

# read a parquet file
select * from '/home/pengfei/data_set/sf_fire/sf_fire_snappy.parquet' limit 1;
```
## 6. Use python odbc client to connect to a duckdb via odbc

You can find an example of read a parquet file directly and load a parquet file to a table in this [file](../src/odbc_manager.py)
