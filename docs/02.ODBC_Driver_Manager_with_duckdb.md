# Setup a odbc data source for duckdb

## 1. Install Duck db

DuckDB is an **in-process SQL OLAP** database management system

For more information, you can visit their official [website](https://duckdb.org/)

It offers many API, Here I only show the CLI API for linux.

For other API installations, you can go to [[https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/|installation page]]

```shell
# get the latest stable binary
wget https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/releases/download/v0.8.0/duckdb_cli-linux-amd64.zip

# unzip it
unzip duckdb_cli-linux-amd64.zip

# after unzip, you will find a binary called duckdb, use the below command to run it
./duckdb
```



## 2. Load different data sources

Duckdb can read the below data sources:
  * json
  * csv
  * parquet

Here, we only show csv and parquet

### 2.1  Load csv files

```shell
# read the csv file with auto infer header, delimiter, etc. 
select * from read_csv_auto('file.csv')

# if the infered delimiter is not correct, we can overwrite it
select * from read_csv_auto('file.csv', delimiter='|')

# create a temporaray table
create table sf_fire as select * from read_csv_auto('/home/pengfei/data_set/sf_fire/sf_fire.csv');

```

### 2.2 Load parquet files ====

```shell
create table sf_fire as select * from read_parquet('/home/pengfei/data_set/sf_fire/sf_fire_snappy.parquet');
```



### 2.3 Run some SQL operation

Once you have created a table, you can use all the functions of SQL to manipulate the table. Below are some simple examples

```sql
select * from sf_fire limit 5;

select count(*) as total_row from sf_fire;

select CallType, count(*) as call_number from sf_fire group by CallType order by call_number desc;
```

**DuckDB does not persist any table, after shutdown, all tables will be lost**. If you want to save the table, 
you need to export the table in csv, or parquet files

## 3. Export data

### 3.1 Export data to CSV files

```shell
# let's create a table which we want to export
create table call_type as select CallType, count(*) as call_number from sf_fire group by CallType order by call_number desc;

# now let's export table call_type to a csv file
COPY call_type TO '/tmp/output.csv' (HEADER, DELIMITER ',');

# The result of queries can also be directly exported to a CSV file.
COPY (SELECT * FROM call_type) TO '/tmp/output.csv' (HEADER, DELIMITER ',');
```
### 3.2 Export data to parquet files

```shell
COPY call_type TO '/tmp/output.parquet' (FORMAT PARQUET);

COPY (SELECT * FROM call_type) TO '/tmp/output.parquet' (FORMAT PARQUET);
```
